    "\n",
    "when we have a large array and a smaller array, we often want to use the smaller array many times on the larger, e.g. a matrix whose columns we want to add the same vector to. we could stack the vector several times to get it to the correct dimension before adding the two, but numpy has a \"broadcasting mechanism\" that allows us to skip this often very-time-consuming step.\n",
    "\n",
    "in a nutshell, there are 5 rules to broadcasting:\n",
    "1. if two arrays do not have the same rank, add one dimension on the left until they do (i.e. 'prepend' it)\n",
    "  - e.g. if we have a.shape = (3,3,10) and b.shape = (10), then b gets recast as b.shape = (1,1,10)\n",
    "2. two arrays are \"compatible\" in a dimension if either\n",
    "  - they have the same size in that dimension (e.g. (1,3,5) and (4,3,2) are compatible in dimension 2)\n",
    "  - one or both has size one in that dimension\n",
    "3. arrays can be broadcast only if they are compatible in all dimensions\n",
    "4. the resulting array after broadcasting has the maximum size between the two broadcasted arrays at each dimension \n",
    "  - (1,3,5) and (4,3,1) gets broadcast to (4,3,5)\n",
    "5. if array 1 has size 1 in a dimension, and array 2 has size > 1 in that dimension, the broadcast array acts as if it were copied along that dimension\n",
    "  - in the example for (4), the values corresponding to dimension 1 (with size 1) get copied 4 times; i.e., [3] gets broadcast to [3, 3, 3, 3]\n",
